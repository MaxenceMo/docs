description: 'How to access API endpoints ?'

  All API endpoints, with the exception of the `/login` endpoint, are authenticated using Bearer tokens.
  To obtain a Bearer token, you need to authenticate yourself with a `clientId` and a `clientSecret` using the `/login` endpoint.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
