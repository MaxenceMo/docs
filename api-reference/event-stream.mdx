<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your filters">
  **Customize your event stream or map** by specifying the types of events you want to see.

  For instance:
  - **music** and **performance** events: `categories` = **['musique', 'spectacle']**
  - events from **Shotgun** and **Dice**: `sources` = **['dice', 'shotgun']**
  - events in paris:
    - `locationFilter.circle.lat` = **48.864716**
    - `locationFilter.circle.lng` = **2.349014**
    - `locationFilter.circle.maxDistance` = **10000**
  - events taking place next week:
    - `datesFilter.minDate` = **2025-01-01T08:00:00.000Z**
    - `datesFilter.maxDate` = **2025-01-07T23:00:00.000Z**
  - free events:
    - `pricesFilter.lowestPrice` = **0**
    - `pricesFilter.highestPrice` = **0**
  - ...
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the results">
  Use `data` to show events in your stream or map.

  You can see the number of events corresponding to your filters in `pagination.totalItems`.
  If you want to show more than the `limit` number of events, you can increment `pageNumber` as long as it is less than `totalPages`.

  Information about the partners selling the event are available in `data.sources`.
  <Tip>You can use the `data.sources.link` to redirect your users to the site of the partner selling the event and generate sales.</Tip>
