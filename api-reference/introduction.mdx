## Welcome

Wander's API provides two modes of event data interaction: **Direct Event Data Serving** and **Event Data Fetching and Storage**. Depending on your needs, you can either retrieve data in real-time without storing it or fetch and store data for later use.

### Direct Event Data Serving

In this mode, you retrieve event data on demand, without storing it. This is ideal for applications needing live event data.

#### Available Endpoints:

- **Get events**: Retrieve events based on filters (e.g., location, date, type). Perfect for populating a live event feed or map.

- **Get event**: Fetch detailed data for a specific event, useful for creating individual event pages.

- **Get place**: Retrieve events for a particular venue, useful for showing events happening at specific locations.

- **Get performer**: Fetch events related to a specific performer, useful for showing all events for an artist.

- **Search**: Implement a search bar to find events, places, or performers.

### Event Data Fetching and Storage

This mode is suitable when you need to store event data for further use and keep it updated.

#### Available Endpoint:

- **Get events catalogue**: Retrieve all events and store them. You can also update existing data by specifying the date when the data was last fetched.
