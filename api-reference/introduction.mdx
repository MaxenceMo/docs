## Welcome

Wander's API provides two modes of event data interaction: **Direct Event Data Serving** and **Event Data Fetching and Storage**. Depending on your needs, you can either retrieve data in real-time without storing it or fetch and store data for later use.

### Direct Event Data Serving

In this mode, you retrieve event data on demand, without storing it. This is ideal for applications needing live event data.

#### Available Endpoints:

- [Get events](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/get-events): Retrieve events based on filters (e.g., location, date, type). Perfect for populating a live event feed or map.

- [Get event](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/get-event): Fetch detailed data for a specific event, useful for creating individual event pages.

- [Dynamic search](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/dynamic-search): Implement a search bar to find events, places, or performers.

- [Get place events](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/get-place-events): Fetch detailed information about a Google Place, including scheduled events.

- [Search place events](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/search-place-events): Search for events in a place by name.

- [Get performer events](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/get-performer-events): Get performerâ€™s whole informations and the events in which they take part.

- [Search performer events](/api-reference/direct-event-data-serving/search-performer-events): Search for events by performer name.

### Event Data Fetching and Storage

This mode is suitable when you need to store event data for further use and keep it updated.

#### Available Endpoint:

- [Get events catalogue](/api-reference/event-data-fetching-and-storage/get-events-catalogue): Retrieve all events and store them. You can also update existing data by specifying the date when the data was last fetched.
