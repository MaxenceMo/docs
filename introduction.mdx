## Introduction

**Wander** is a **real-time event data hub** that aggregates event information from **multiple ticketing partners** and makes it available through an **API**.

The platform centralizes data on a wide range of events, such as **concerts**, **shows**, and **exhibitions**, from various sources like **FnacSpectacles**, **Ticketmaster**, and more.

Wander provides **businesses** and **developers** with easy access to this event data via its API, enabling them to **integrate** it into their **own applications** or **systems**.

Moreover, Wander **monetizes** the events by offering its partners a **commission** on each ticket sold, creating a **revenue-sharing model**.
This enables companies to both utilize **up-to-date event data** and benefit from the **financial opportunities** it provides.
